# Hi, I’m Shashwat Awasthi (@shashwat6797)

I’m a software engineer focused on web & systems development, with hands-on experience in full-stack web apps, desktop/C++ tooling, WordPress/WooCommerce integrations, and modern ML-backed retrieval systems. I enjoy building practical tools I use personally and turning them into open-source projects so others can benefit.

---

## 🔭 What I build
- Full-stack web applications (Next.js, React, Vue) and REST/GraphQL backends (Node.js, Spring Boot, FastAPI).  
- Production-ready microservices with Docker, CI/CD (Jenkins / GitHub Actions), and cloud deployment (AWS / Azure).  
- Desktop applications and performance-focused tooling in modern C++ (Qt, OpenCV).  
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, embeddings pipelines, and document chatbots.  
- WordPress/WooCommerce plugins and automation for business workflows (WhatsApp integrations, order events).

## 🛠 Technical skills

**Languages & Runtimes**
- JavaScript / TypeScript, Node.js, Deno  
- Java (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI), C / C++ (modern C++14/17/20)  
- PHP (WordPress / WooCommerce)

**Frontend**
- React, Next.js, Vue, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind (basic)

**Backend & Datastores**

- AWS (S3, Lambda, basics of infra), Azure fundamentals  
- Logging / monitoring basics (ELK-style approaches)

**Tools, Libraries & Others**
- Git, GitHub, Multer (file uploads), WebSockets, Electron (familiarity), OpenCV, Poppler, HarfBuzz (exposure)  
- Embeddings / RAG pipelines, vector stores (conceptual + implemented pipelines)  
- UI/icon tooling (Lucide icons), charts (ApexCharts)

## 📂 Selected projects

> Short descriptions — link each to the repo(s) in your profile when you add them.

- **RAG PDF Chatbot** — Ingests PDFs, creates embeddings, and answers queries using retrieval + generation. (PDF parsing → embeddings → chat interface).  
- **Embeddings Converter** — Utility pipeline that converts text to embeddings and indexes them for retrieval.  
- **Typing Test Game** — Lightweight web app measuring speed & accuracy, with performance and UX polish.  
- **WooCommerce Wizup WhatsApp Integration** — WordPress plugin that sends order-status template messages (new order, shipped, delivered, abandoned cart) via Wizup API. Includes template payload examples, header images, and quick-reply flows.  
- **WhatsApp Appointment Chatbot** — A WhatsApp-first appointment scheduler for local businesses with booking, rescheduling, calendar sync and reminders (no third-party dependency design).  
- **File Upload / Profile Backend** — Backend function for user profile creation with file uploads (Multer + MongoDB) and validation flows.  
- **Mini Projects / Tools** — Console utilities, file parsers, and a couple of Qt desktop prototypes (notepad-like apps, simple image processors).

## 🧭 What I’m doing now / availability
- Actively building both web/cloud systems and C++ desktop tooling in parallel to target product & cloud roles.  
- Open to contributor collaborations, freelance projects, and mentorship opportunities.  
- Available for short-term freelance work — reach out via email.
